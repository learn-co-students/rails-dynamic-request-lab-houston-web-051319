# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
student1 = Student.create(first_name: "yosyas",last_name: "tsegai")
student2 = Student.create(first_name: "elias",last_name: "tsegai")
student3 = Student.create(first_name: "lidya",last_name: "tsegai")
